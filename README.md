- 👋 Hi, I’m @KayOtiq
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and coaching all things automation, including jenkins, docker, kubernetes, selenium, unit and regression testing in Java and .Net
- 📚 I’m currently learning kubernetes, AWS, dockerfiles, python and whatever comes up for my next adventure
- 🤝🏼 I’m looking to collaborate on taking over the world
- 📫 How to reach me ...

I'd love to show you all the cool stuff I'm currently working right now, but it is on my employer's GHEC account and they don't like to share 😢
